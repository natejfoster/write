          <p className='about__paragraph'>
            By bringing reflection, discovery, and expression together in an online space, <em>Write</em> reclaims the meaning and clarity lost in digital communication.

            Letter writing is a unique opportunity to reflect, discover, and express. Physically writing a letter is time consuming and associated with insecurities like bad handwriting and poor writing skills. On the other hand, digital communication is temporary and lacks meaning. <em>Write</em> makes it easy to send and receive meaningful communication not intermixed with the other to-dos and logistics cluttering our email inboxes, text histories, and voicemails. 
          </p>
          <p className='about__paragraph'>
            If youâ€™re feeling stuck while writing, <em>Write</em> prompts you with self-reflective questions to ask yourself and your loved ones. Once you send a letter with <em>Write</em>, it will be delivered at a random moment within seven days after sending. When someone knows the exact moment a message was delivered and seen, an expectation for a hasty response is placed on both the sender and receiver. By delivering letters serendipitously, <em>Write</em> creates a space for reflecting on the content of the letter.
